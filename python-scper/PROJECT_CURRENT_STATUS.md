## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT STATUS: COMPREHENSIVE SECTION SCANNING IMPLEMENTED ACROSS ALL METHODS + FRONTEND MAPPING FIXED + ACCOMMODATION FIELD MAPPING EXECUTION FIXED! ðŸš€âœ¨**

### **ðŸ“Š PHASE 1 & 2 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:**

#### **âœ… PRIORITY 1: HP/KW EXTRACTION - SOLVED with AI Text Scanning + Enhanced Section Scanning**
- **Status:** âœ… **COMPLETELY SOLVED**
- **Solution:** AI-powered text scanning + comprehensive section scanning
- **Implementation:** 
  - AI text scanning as PRIORITY 1 method
  - Enhanced section scanning in traditional Selenium method
  - Enhanced section scanning in fallback method
  - Multiple HP/KW pattern recognition
  - Post-processing AI results with regex patterns
- **Result:** HP/KW values now successfully extracted and displayed in UI
- **Evidence:** Console shows "âœ… HP mapped from backend: 110" and "âœ… KW mapped from backend: 80.96"

#### **âœ… PRIORITY 2: ACCOMMODATION SECTION - SOLVED with Comprehensive Section Scanning + Frontend Mapping Fixed + Field Mapping Execution Fixed**
- **Status:** âœ… **COMPLETELY SOLVED**
- **Solution:** Comprehensive section scanning across ALL methods + Frontend accommodation field mapping + Field mapping execution fixed
- **Implementation:**
  - AI text scanning method (PRIORITY 1)
  - Traditional Selenium method (PRIORITY 2) - Enhanced with comprehensive scanning
  - Fallback method (PRIORITY 3) - Enhanced with comprehensive scanning
  - Full page text scanning for accommodation patterns
  - Multiple extraction methods (HTML, tables, text, meta tags)
  - **FRONTEND FIX:** Comprehensive accommodation field mapping in `processScrapedData` and migration handler
  - **EXECUTION FIX:** Critical fallbacks and debugging to ensure accommodation field mapping always runs
- **Result:** Accommodation data now extracted from full page text AND properly mapped to frontend form fields AND form field population code executes
- **Evidence:** Console shows accommodation data in "All available fields" list + comprehensive accommodation mapping logs + accommodation field mapping execution logs
