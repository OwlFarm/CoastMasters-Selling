## ‚ö†Ô∏è **AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**

### **1. Migration & Populate Integration (0% Complete)**
```typescript
// Current: Placeholder buttons without functionality
<Button variant="secondary">
    <Binary className="mr-2" />
    Migrate
</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">
    <Sparkles className="mr-2" />
    Populate
</Button>
```

### **2. Schema Flexibility for Scraping (70% Complete)**
- **Good**: Comprehensive field coverage
- **Needs**: Semantic mapping and term normalization
- **Missing**: Field aliases and value standardization

### **3. Data Quality & Validation (80% Complete)**
- **Good**: Type coercion and optional fields
- **Needs**: Semantic validation and confidence scoring
- **Missing**: Cross-field validation logic

## üîß **RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Priority 1: Schema Enhancement for Scraping**
```typescript
// Add to schemas.ts
export const fieldAliases = {
  // Broker site variations
  'LOA': ['length', 'loaM', 'overallLength'],
  'Beam': ['beamM', 'width', 'beam'],
  'Draft': ['draftM', 'depth', 'keelDepth'],
  
  // Term normalization
  'GRP': ['fiberglass', 'glass reinforced plastic'],
  'Volvo Penta': ['volvo', 'volvo penta', 'volvo-penta'],
  'Sailing Yacht': ['sailboat', 'sailing vessel', 'sail yacht']
};

export const semanticValidation = {
  // Cross-field validation
  'draftM': (value: number, formData: any) => 
    value <= formData.loaM * 0.3, // Draft shouldn't exceed 30% of length
  
  'price': (value: number, formData: any) => 
    value > 0 && value < 10000000 // Reasonable price range
};
```

### **Priority 2: Migration System Integration**
```typescript
// Enhanced sell-form.tsx
interface MigrationData {
  sourceUrl: string;
  confidence: number;
  mappedFields: Record<string, any>;
  unmappedFields: string[];
  suggestions: string[];
}

const [migrationQueue, setMigrationQueue] = useState<MigrationData[]>([]);
const [isMigrating, setIsMigrating] = useState(false);

const handleMigration = async (url: string) => {
  setIsMigrating(true);
  try {
    const result = await scrapeListing(url);
    if (result.batchMode) {
      setMigrationQueue(prev => [...prev, result]);
    } else {
      populateForm(result.mappedFields);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    toast({ variant: 'destructive', title: 'Migration Failed', description: error.message });
  } finally {
    setIsMigrating(false);
  }
};
```

### **Priority 3: Enhanced Form Population**
```typescript
// Smart form population with confidence indicators
const populateForm = (data: Partial<FormValues>, confidence: number = 1) => {
  Object.entries(data).forEach(([field, value]) => {
    if (value !== null && value !== undefined) {
      form.setValue(field as keyof FormValues, value);
      
      // Show confidence indicator for populated fields
      if (confidence < 0.8) {
        form.setError(field as keyof FormValues, {
          type: 'warning',
          message: `Low confidence (${Math.round(confidence * 100)}%) - please verify`
        });
      }
    }
  });
};
```
