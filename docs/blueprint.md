## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#191970) to convey trust, stability, and a premium feel, reminiscent of the nautical environment.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#D0D8E0), a desaturated variant of navy, provides a calming and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Gold (#D4AF37) for highlights and call-to-action buttons to signal luxury, exclusivity, and importance.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, will create a modern, machined look.
- Use nautical-themed icons, modern interpretation, to provide instant recognition. Use only outlined icons to maintain a minimalist approach.
- Employ a grid-based layout system to ensure consistency and responsiveness across various devices. Utilize white space effectively to create a clean and uncluttered user interface. Cards with glassmorphism effects will present yacht listings and information modules.
- Incorporate micro-animations for hover effects, loading states, and transitions to enhance user interaction and provide visual feedback. Use subtle, smooth animations that are not distracting but add a layer of sophistication.
